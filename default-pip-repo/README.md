# Demo of configuring default Python package repositories using Terraform

For Serverless workloads, administrators are now able to [configure location of Python repositories](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/compute/serverless/dependencies#configure-default-python-package-repositories) that will be used to find Python packages.  This is done by creating a secret scope with the predefined name and adding secrets with predefined names into it.

This Terraform module shows how to do it.  You need to configure `terraform.tfvars` with the following variables:

- `pip_index_url` - (required, string) the URL of PIP index that will be used by default.
- `pip_extra_index_urls` - (optional, string) the comma-separated list of URLs for additional of PIP indexes.
- `pip_index_url` - (optional, string) the SSL certificate of the PIP server to avoid certificate validation errors if server uses a certificate generated by custom certificate authority.

And then [configure authentication](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs#authentication) to point to your workspace, and follow standard `terraform init/plan/apply` sequence.
